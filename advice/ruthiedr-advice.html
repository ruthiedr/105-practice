    <h1>so you wanna learn how to code?</h1>
    <h2>sweet! here are my top tips from what i've learned thus far</h2>
    </div>
  <div class="list">
    <ul>
      <li>have patience with yourself. although it's fun, learning to write code is not easy. You might not learn a lot right off the bat but just know that if you're persistent, you'll get it soon.
      <li>celebrate what you learn, <span>even</span> especially what seem to be the little insignificant things. sometimes we forget how far we've really come and become disheartened. remember where you started and moving forward won't seem so hard.</li>
      <li>start writing! from day one, start writing code based off what you learn and build on them as you learn. not only is this great for finding out what kind of code you like to write, it's a chance for you to get a headstart on  a portfolio.</li>
      <li>listen to music/podcasts/netflix if you can focus. for me personally, i know i'm going to be at least 75% more motivated and productive if I'm coding while listening to some noise coming through my ear buds. Could just be me, idk.</li>
      <li>watch youtube videos from self-built coders and programmers in general. it's very motivating and you can find out which mistakes not to make if you're wanting to build a career.
      <li>be curious! keep asking questions about your code and never stop digging until you find answers. it's the only way you'll learn along with trial and error.
      <li>realize it's ok to go through periods of time where you feel unmotivated, but also that if this is something you're serious about, that it's important to eventually get back up on the horse.
    </ul>
